Beyond the treatment outcome the entire experience was chaotic After moving our patient out of the ICU they transferred her to a completely different building far from the brain department The staff was disorganized and unhelpful and only after persistent effort was I able to have her moved back to the appropriate building

Moreover even if the chances of recovery are close to zero they offer false assurances claiming a high success rate like 90 just to encourage you to proceed After draining every last bit of your money they eventually admit that theres nothing more they can do In the end you risk losing both your loved one and your savings",Negative

The consultation was rushed to the point of negligence No proper history was taken no thorough physical examination was done  things that are the bare minimum in any clinical setting An ultrasound which is often essential in such cases was not even performed until I questioned her directly And when she did finally do it she was simultaneously attending to two other patients Thats not just unprofessional  its outright unsafe

This kind of multitasking might be understandable in an overburdened government hospital but in a private setup where youre paying Rs 5000 for a consultation and there are only a few patients waiting its completely unacceptable It felt like a rushed careless conveyor belt rather than proper medical care

As a fellow doctor I genuinely hate calling out someone from my own profession but this experience was horrible Patients  especially in a private setting  deserve time attention and care not this kind of dismissive and distracted treatment I sincerely hope Shifa International takes this seriously",Negative

They kept delaying his discharge and kept him over 78 weeks so you can imagine the cost He is basically a skeleton thanks to their service

117,Hospital,33.6965775,73.0504561,Advanced International Hospital Islamabad,3.0,4.4,"I visited Advance International Hospital today for an MRI scan While the medical staff and services were professional I was genuinely disappointed and concerned about one basic facility clean drinking water

There was no water cooler available anywhere in the hospital for visitors or patients I checked with the pharmacy and they only had chilled bottled water which is not suitable for everyone especially in a hospital setting Even worse no glass or cup was available to drink water from which made the situation more frustrating

In a place labeled International Hospital I expected at least the minimum standard of patient care which includes access to normal temperature drinking water

Im sharing this review with the hope that hospital management will take this seriously and ensure that all patients and visitors have access to basic facilities like clean roomtemperature water and drinking glasses Its not just a comfort issue  its a matter of health and dignity",Neutral

The consultation charges are excessively high5000 for just one minute If a patient has prior knowledge about their condition he becomes visibly frustrated

When I visited him I was already undergoing treatment as per my previous doctors prescription Instead of considering my test results Dr Shazli seemed irritated that I had them done beforehand He ended up prescribing the same active ingredients but from different pharmaceutical companies which felt unnecessary

No one would be naive enough to keep spending on such a doctor",Negative

I had to take my mother in for treatment We were there for a grand total of 10 days In those 10 days I saw the doctors surgeons Dr Fauzaan Abdullah surgeon Ferogh Elahi Dr  Prof Rizwan Dr Hamid give us 100 attention and care They updated us every step of the way and ensured the treatment moved ahead quickly and efficiently
The day to day staff in general ward Mehvish Rubina Rimsha all the housekeeping staff were brilliant The care they gave was immaculate Always on hand and ready to treat Smiling all the same
IPD1 another fabulous team Usama Komal Sania day and night staff Dr Abdullah all the staff I cant speak about enough Fantastic My mother still talks about all of you so highly
The cleanliness is spot on  near perfect
The canteen staff were so helpful and polite
Overall the supervising staff ensuring everything was quality controlled took their jobs very seriously Theres no messing about
X rays CT scans IV drips medication all conducted in a timely manner Round the clock care for patients here is not taken lightly
The transporters who take patients in wheelchairs thank you
Of course any hospital will be pricey in islamabad Not all hospitals charge extortion and give you the best care possible Some can charge extortion and give you the worst care
Im so glad I made the right choice in bringing my mother here After her operation she is no longer in pain or suffering but alhamdulillah has recovered very well
Technology here is top notch
Security is tight one attendant per patient Dont try bringing too many visitors you wont be allowed in but made to wait
So sorry this review is an essay but I cannot thank this hospital or the staff enough Our every need was taken care of
I was scared at first reading other reviews on many hospitals but this was the only one that gave me faith that I would be in good hands

Again a heartfelt thank you for treating my mother with love and care",Positive

I had bad experience twice with them
My first experience was in August 2024 I was extremely unwell and got admitted Before admission I had to do some procedural steps and payments and the the behaviour of accounts department was insensitive They made me wait for 15 hour and were not telling me the next steps the person who took the payment from me asked me to wait for him till he gets back and he did not came backAnd when I approached other staff again n again they first made me wait and after 15 hour one of them at last informed me that my request can be processed at the moment
My second bad experience was of today I  visited Dr Saleh Gastroenterologist for a follow up visit on the advice of the Doctor who treated me in the previous visit He was extremely rude to me and kept saying that why did you come here you have no health issues He was not ready to listen to me about my issue and made me feel dumb and embarrassed He said that I am facing psychiatric issues If it helps considers that I am mentally disturbed the he should definitely treat me with concern and not with cold and rude behavior He said that some other patient could have been adjusted in my place and I wasted his time

Few things should be improved at such expensive hospital
1 Zero parking availability Specially in weekdays at times of opd Also you have to park your car long away from hospital if you dont want to give your car to valet
2 Sitting spaces are very limited all accross the hospital You have to stand at most of the places There should be chairs placed in corridors
3 Cafe is very very very expensive even more than hospital and their behaviour is very rude Also food taste is not good even tea is not fresh available Same for tuck shops Also you cant order food online as they dont allow outside food This should be improved and people should be allowed to order online at least and eat in cafeteria",Neutral

They charge double than what ANY facility in the country charges and they dont give the MRI films with the report as well you have to buy them for surplus fee separately their online portal doesnt upload the MRI images either its not like the radiologists report is any better than other facilities BTW their 1030 off night deals are only available when you ASK them otherwise they try their best to make the patient avoid that

My appointment was at 9 but they started the scan by 1015 One has to walk a whole floor and down and wait there for 30 minutes to get turn The MRI machine is very old very loud the headphones dont work and uncomfortable Other facilities do better

After the scan the nurse told me she is staying there only for me and it was her off time  like  I am the patient here Please talk to your manager

The services provided are virtually nonexistent and youll be nickelanddimed for every basic necessity Its appalling how hospitals like Advance International have turned healthcare into a ruthless business preying on peoples vulnerability

I am writing about a patient who needed knee surgery We visited the Islamabad International Hospital and Research Center located in E112 There we consulted Dr Shams an orthopedic surgeon who advised that surgery was necessary This hospital offers services under the Sehat Sahulat Card Since the patient was from Punjab the treatment was to be carried out using the Sehat Card

The doctor gave us a few tests to get done saying that the rest of the treatment would be covered by the card However the tests that normally cost around 3000 rupees at IDC like CBC and others were charged at 10000 rupees here After reviewing the reports they scheduled the surgery for the next day But then just before the surgery the same tests were repeated again and this time the charges were deducted from the Sehat Card

After the operation the doctors shifted the patient to a ward that had no staff no AC and even the fans werent working The lights turned on and off randomly The ward was full of mosquitoes The patient was in severe pain but no staff member came After two hours a nurse finally showed up and asked us to go buy an injection and a drip ourselves She then administered it This was despite the fact that all medicines were supposed to be free under the Sehat Card I ended up buying all the required medicines out of pocket spending around 40000 rupees in total

The next day the dressing was supposed to be changed at 10 AM We waited until 1 PM and were told that someone from the operation theater would come to change the dressing Even though emergency staff was present we pleaded and repeatedly requested them to change the dressing warning that it could lead to infection due to bleeding and germsbut no one listened

Later I found out that room charges were also deducted from the Sehat Card despite the patient being kept in a ward with such terrible conditions that anyone would faint just looking at it

Eventually I had to shift the patient to Ali Medical Hospital F8 where proper treatment could be provided This hospital Islamabad International Hospital exists solely to make money Their goal is just to exploit and humiliate the poor",Negative

My niece had a minor injury on her tongue so I took her there Dr Zainulabideen examined her and suggested that she needed surgery and stitches using anesthesia for an 11monthold baby After he left another staff member quoted a price of 25000 PKR which they quickly discounted to 18000 PKR Feeling uneasy I stepped outside to call my cousin who has worked at Maroof International Hospital for 11 years When I returned a nurse told me the cost was now 12000 PKR again with discounts

I was really uncomfortable with the situation and decided to go to Maroof International Hospitals F10 emergency ward instead There the doctor reassured us that it was just a minor injury and that there was no need for surgery or stitches He explained that at 11 months old her tongue would heal on its own over time

This isnt just about the money they quoted us it felt like they were more focused on making a profit rather than considering the wellbeing of their patients It was really disheartening to see that their priority seemed to be earning money instead of genuinely caring for peoples lives

I will never recommend this hospital They prioritize making money over the health and wellbeing of their patients which is really disappointing

My experience made it clear that they dont genuinely care about peoples lives

Overall I felt misled and frustrated with the experience at IIHRC",Negative

The female emergency ward was cold as a morgue The staff kept on trying to find the vein and in that they pricked me at 4 different places and kept on moving the needle while it was inside my arm and my hands got bruised badly

Then I kept on asking the nurses and staff to update me whats next but there was no answer I had to force them to stop my iv and I got up from my bed and stood at the counter for an hour to get the treatment that k rightfully and legally deserved The reception staff was extremely rude and gave me no direct answer

Although I was insured and this hospital was on pannel but just because the guy at the reception was handling the name of insurance provider for the first time Tpl he took more than an hour to send one email

The major reason of writing this post is to bring to light the extremely poorlousyrudeincompetent and careless attitude of staff at Fast Track and Acute Bay at PAF HospitalI had been administered IV doses earlier as well but never encountered any such problems as that was ShifaDespite my repeated warnings to be careful while pricking for canulathe very first day the staff made more than one attempt to find the right vein and thus one vein damaged in an extremely bad manner resulting in severe swelling and painThe second day the canula was leaking when they started the doseI was screaming with pain and blood oozing out and floor incharge in evening Dr Hajra instead of consoling me said that this is very normal
and I was behaving like a PSYCHO if I complained of pain or the duty staff nurse being inattentive When I argued she called the female guards and said you can leave and go to Shifa for injection
I was alone that day and my husband was travelling so felt quite helpless
Thus was a totally inhumane actThis behaviour continued till my last doseThey are understaffed and untrained
My IV was supposed to be administered in 30 min and I was the one telling the staff on duty on daily basis to administer it slowly as otherwise it used to swell the veins
I can narrate a lot of other instances but to cut long story short PAF is a butchery
And yes to make a fool of me when I complained to the DR he called the admin guy and he made me lodge a written complaint and no action taken so far11 days passed",Negative

During her time in sICU we witnessed concerningly irresponsible behaviour from some of the duty staff which only added to our worries Following her death we reached out to hospital admistration to review the CCTV footage to understand the delay that led to her hypoxia Despite our efforts our request was denied and after 2 months of internal investigation yielded no answers about what caused the delay We were heartbroken not only by the loss of our mother but by the hospitals lack of transparency and response to our concerns

Though anxious I explained my concerns including my history of IBS stress and fear of tooth extraction Dr Sohaib reassured me with a calm and clear explanation that made the procedure feel much less intimidating His communication skills were exceptional and his thorough explanation put me at ease right away

Throughout the entire process Dr Sohaib guided me step by step He even remembered the small details I had mentioned during my consultation which showed how attentive he was The extraction itself went smoothly and I remained calm thanks to his reassurance and professionalism He frequently checked on me to ensure I wasnt feeling any pain

Although I initially thought he seemed young his expertise and professionalism quickly became evident I had an outstanding experience and would rate him 10 out of 10 The fear I once had about wisdom tooth extraction is now completely gone and I would highly recommend Dr Sohaib to anyone in need of oral surgery or dental care",Positive

So my baby was discharge after more than a month in nicu Im going back to followup with the paediatrician on g floor n im sitting in sofa waiting My baby is preemie Very small He had an episode where he vomited through the nose I was panicking so im running to nicu on the 3rd floors Coz in my mind only they have proper tools for his small body when Im in there nurse confirmed there was milk in his nose Instead of helping him the black clothing lady who is looking much higher status than the green clothes nurse saying why didnt u bring him to ER
I was saying i was here to meet PD incase she was thinking that im specifically coming to nicu only for cleaning his nose but she cut me off  n  keep asking or they way shes talking a little intimidating why didnt u bring to er n not letting me to speak they dont want to n will not helping him so just bring him to er My baby was still with the nurse while this was happened so she just giving jim back coz the black clothes lady saying that I was shock Idk why i feel that lady think i want free help or something they can just ask me his patient number n they can charge me i can pay before taking him back i mean i spent more than 14 lakh already plus With the cost of his first hospital i spent more than 2 millions on my baby so the price of small procedure like suctioning is nothing to me im willing to pay more if its help my baby At the end after she kicking me out she just saying next time just bring him to ER or maybe PICU all the people in nicu then ignoring me Thats heartbreaking attitude for a mother you know
Like heck He just discharged a week ago from nicu n hes still too small not even 2 kg so of course in my mind nicu can help him better I was refused by ER before in other hospital coz he was too small for context  PAF is not where my baby was born we move to paf nicu after he was discharged with weight still under 1kg from the first hospital he have a lot of episodes like sleep apnea n airway blockage at that time n some er refused him coz they dont have proper tools to help small baby
I hope that 1 lady in black clothing read this its been many days but i am still having a grudge I dont like you you are mean to refused to help him while he was there already Like what if its urgent n its  blocking babys airway u gonna insist that the parents just bring the baby 3 floor down waiting quite sometime for lift to coming or using stairs passing 3 floors down while holding the baby in state of panic Or to picu where he was never there or be their patient to know his past conditions",Neutral

This hospital is all about the money at the cost of just about everything Today the cash counter was broken and they were funneling people in herds here and there to ensure they are charged for everything except maybe using the toilet And the toilets are filthy and like street public toilets

The lab is an grossly incompetent couple of desks in the open and they actually incorrectly labeled my samples due to not printing labels when they were supposed to and I wrote a written complaint that Im sure no one will do anything about Im sure they have done this to many other patients since they were in discussion about which sample belonged to who This hospital charges top dollar for its subpar services and is not some government hospital but you wouldnt be able to guess from the way it is operated The values of the administration trickle down to the staff which are do not let the money go even if you are botching peoples diagnostic samples Never get blood or urine tests done from here if you care about your health Due to a couple of good doctors one is forced to come here for the time being but otherwise itd be no ones first choice To boost their own coffers they have a bazillion panels operating so the crowd youll find is uncouth unpolished and the kind that will ram into you while walking and not even offer a seat to a heavily pregnant woman Pathetic place

The staff is the most hideously incompetent I have seen anywhere and to protect them theyve posted signs everywhere about how abuse of employees will not be tolerated while the latter make every mistake in the book and have low IQs

574,Hospital,33.708229,73.015313,PAF Hospital Islamabad,1.0,3.7,"Recently I underwent a minor surgery at PAF Hospital where I had an incredibly unpleasant experience After the surgery the ward team repeatedly insisted that I needed an injection before being discharged They assured me it had been ordered would take about an hour to arrive However after waiting for two to three hours they began calling the pharmacy to check on the injections availability indicating it hadnt been ordered at all

When I offered to arrange the injection myself and I arranged the injection from the pharmacy within the hospital they insisted only a doctor could administer it leading to another three hours of waiting for doctor Eventually the doctor informed me that the injection wasnt necessary after all Throughout my stay there were continuous efforts to inflate my bill including adding charges for food we didnt order and additional medications Moreover during surgery they used specific pharmacy where basic items like an IV set were priced significantly higher compared to other places within or outside the hospital

When I raised these concerns instead of addressing them everyone started blaming each other

If a Doctor is not available then why you give appointment in his name and another fake doctor is in his place letter pad in name of original doctor who is absent My family appointment was with Brig R Prof Dr Abdul Halim but as he was absent so another doctor was in his place As written with the name Retired so you should do a good work with the impersonator age put an old doctor He was caught as the prescription that he advised was worse and to no ashame they told her to visit another Doctor and while my family visited the other Doctor they said they you have to pay the fee a fee for a scammer doctor and then fee for a real doctor The family who has been betrayed multiple times but still have to visit as the kid was suffering from chickenpox
For the employees structure its very clear that most of the employees are not from medical field and they seem to be from different line of work with reference they got the job like you put a mechanic in medical field an electrician in laboratory so they donot know how to do the job And they are sure that they will not lose the job
I am an Engineer and i am in Iraq right now and i saw my son in morning i was right away with the comment that the kid is suffering from chickenpox but sadly the fake doctor couldnt guessed it  I am writing this email to get a reply and I will post this as a review as well and then I will post your answer as well

There is no one window operation for payments rather you have to pay separately to consultant doctors blood bank and the hospital which becomes very annoying And they insist on taking some payments in cash and upfront

The bloodbank charges you for the blood even if you ask them that you may require the blood during the surgery but during the surgery you dont withdraw this blood from bloodbank They charge you just for making the blood available for you

In the end billing department tries to maximise the hospital profit by putting unreasonable charges in the bill
And this is explainable few months back when one of my acquaintance consultant was negotiating with them to perform his surgeries at this hospital Their manager mehrban told him that their billing formula is simple they charge patient three times the doctors So they adjust their bill according to that

I no longer recommend this hospital as their billing department never listens to reason and always wants to justify their bill even if you point out the anomalies and the services you did not use

Take them to NICU or PICU
The nurses in ward just let the parents take care of the patient only once in Like 45 hourly check
N never stay in general ward Idk whats wrong with the patients n attendants there but THEY ARE FREAKIN NASTY they never flush eventhough the flush button size are very big u can see it instantly Instead they keep peeing n the nightmare is pooping without flushing Like heck stop giving nightmare to other people okay Dont show them you are uncultured We keep saying they are so nasty and not flushing loudly everytime we coming out from the toilet but they keep doing it maybe because we speaks English so they dont understand Thats when i realized that they are most likely a villager I hate them so much for being nasty
We regret so much not letting our baby stay in picu They dont even realize that the cannula got blocked for hours n babys hand swelling from fluid I found it N reporting to them Other hospital put the cannula back in n wait until discharge for cannula removal incase of emergency but in this hospital they just removes
We only go there for the doctor
Thank god we only stay for short time Not even a week

The staff and doctors urgently need to improve their approach to patient care Respect and empathy are fundamental especially considering that patients are the ones who keep the hospital running Disrespect is something that patients neither forget nor forgive I was disheartened by the unprofessional conduct of the doctorif not for the fact that she was a lady I would have addressed my concerns directly and immediately

I myself am a doctor as well and Ive never seen such unprofessional and casual behavior and such horrible communication in hospitals

When you take 13 lacs from someone the least you can do is make sure they are cared for

1 My mother came from surgery I called the recovery room 4 times from the desk in the ward They failed to communicate that my mother who had just undergone major surgery was asking for me and had simply one request for her head to be covered Then I just lost patience and went down myself and turns out she had been there asking for me and a hijab for more than half an hour And when I asked them they said ham nay bahir awaz lagai the what kind of irresponsible behaviour is that Why the hell did you not call upstairs in our room There was no space to sit outside and you cant really expect attendants to sit outside the OT for 5 hours Secondly even if they did not call upstairs what about when I called them 4 times to confirm what was going on Even thinking about it makes me want to cry and scream at the same time but I cant because it would upset my mother

2 Our insurance company paid them in full and yet on every counter for every pre surgical test or exam for admittance for OT clearance we had to roam around or wait for them to get confirmation again and again and again They said we werent allowed to enter our room which had been paid for and booked and confirmed more than 5 times at least by us and the insurance company All the staff had horrible communication amongst themselves I had to call the insurance company guy every single time It made me so angry that my mother cannot even sit in her own room and she was in so much pain Whoever Nadeem Islam sahab is please dont make other patients go through what you made us go through and keep your staff updated about these things

3 There was no one at the covid lab counter when we came We went to 2nd floor for admission to room and they said cant admit without test which is understandable but then they said go to first floor We went there they said go downstairs Finally went downstairs again and got the test done Do you people not realise youre a running a hospital and therefore have patients who are in pain and should not be made to roam about

4 My mother stopped eating at midnight last night and I kept asking them to send her meal 6 hours post surgery and they said 730 per sab patients ka sath aaiy ga I was angry about that because if you dont care a smidge about the fact that the patient has been hungry for HOURS at least care about the fact that youre taking 40k per night and you cant even send food on time So finally at 745 I went and asked again And the guy on the counter casually says to the cafe guy tumny room 7 main khana ni dia And then the cafe guy says unka to likha hua he ni hai IM FURIOUS Didnt say anything though cause they dont actually care Then they bring bland and cold food I sent it back to be heated and asked for 3 sachets of salt He came without salt I reminded him and then he came back with 1 I didnt say anything though cause again koi faida ni hona

5 Wanted a blanket Had to ask 5 times and finally got one And mind you I personally went to the counter to ask for everything everytime Ik this is a small thing Im just adding it to show that every single administrative staff from top to bottom are horribly irresponsible

Staff Jawad and Amir were cooperative though at least behaviour wise insurance verification per time to unho nay bhe lagaya and the physiotherapist was nice as well Ive already mentioned how good the doctor is Id recommend Dr Akbar but at the other hospital he works at

My patient had tonsil removal surgery in your hospital and 1 person allowed admittion time was 800 in the morning since the patient can not come alone and an attendant required accompanied her since morning till night no food was allowed to attendant and neither provided by your hospital and attendant was a diabetic person and cant stay hungry for long time
I think attendant should be a robot or some extra ordinary person who can tolerate hunger for 48 hours because outside food is not allowed which is total inhumane and parhatic secondly ice cream and juice was allowed by doctor himself and that was stoped at the entrance by the bad mannered staff 
Please its a request to look into your so called policy if cant provide food to attendant let them allow to buy it on there own or apply some more charges in your bills for extra food thanks",Negative

I recently underwent a surgical procedure at Shahida Khaliq Hospital performed by the highly skilled Dr Ishtiaq Ur Rehman Orakzai This was my second surgery with Dr Orakzai in the last five months and once again I must commend him for his expertise and care The procedure went exceptionally well and I felt well taken care of throughout my stay

The hospital was neat clean and tidy which immediately made me feel comfortable The doctors and medical staff including Dr Hammad and Dr Shahi Bkaht were incredibly kind and attentive Their dedication to patient care is commendable and they made sure I was comfortable at every stage of my recovery

However I did notice a slight decline in the level of professionalism and support from the administration compared to my last visit While the staff was cooperative their responsiveness wasnt as efficient as I had experienced previously

I would like to highlight an important concern for future patients especially those undergoing surgery or being admitted for longer stays the sweeping staff During my recent visit I lost some personal belongings that were invaluable to me This is not the first time such an incident occurred as I had previously lost some money from my purse during my last surgery I reported the matter to a staff nurse before my discharge hoping the complaint reached the relevant authorities

While my overall experience with the medical team and the surgery itself was excellent I urge the hospital management to address this issue to ensure the safety and security of patients personal items

To anyone considering this hospital I still highly recommend it for the exceptional doctors and overall cleanliness but I advise being cautious with your belongings during your stay",Positive

The nursing staff was exceptionalcaring attentive and incredibly knowledgeable They went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and took the time to answer all of my questions with patience and understanding The doctors were equally impressive providing clear explanations personalized care and a genuine sense of concern for my wellbeing

Even small touches like prompt responses to call buttons and regular updates on my treatment plan demonstrated the staffs commitment to providing topnotch care It was clear that every member of the team was dedicated not just to their jobs but to their patients

Not only did he listen to my concern with patience and genuine care but he also went the extra mile by sharing his direct contact number and asking for all the necessary details and screenshots to understand what had gone wrong His empathy and swift action left me speechless

To my surprise and delight Noman personally arranged to have my entire order resent  fresh complete and with all the items I had originally asked for His dedication to customer satisfaction and his warm respectful manner turned a bad experience into a truly memorable one

I ordered their socalled Crown Crust Pizza and a large fries  both were a complete disaster
The fries were cold stale and tasted like they had been sitting out for hours To make things worse the ketchup provided was clearly some cheap lowquality local brand with a disgusting taste

The pizza itself was no better  completely lacking freshness flavor and quality It tasted like something reheated rather than freshly baked

The staff was shockingly untrained and unprofessional First they served the pizza without any plates After we asked for plates we had to wait again for forks and then again for knives The service was disorganized careless and showed zero hospitality

Its extremely disappointing how a place charging premium prices delivers thirdclass food and pathetic service
Ranchers I8 has lost all standards  I would never recommend it to anyone Save your money time and expectations by staying away from this place
This place is a scam Charging high prices for garbage food and pathetic service
I regret every single rupee spent here They have zero standards zero professionalism and zero sense of customer service
Shame on Ranchers I8 for ruining the name of dining out in Islamabad
I strongly advise everyone to avoid this place unless you enjoy being treated like garbage and served food thats not fit for consumption

Double smash beef burger is one of the best if not the best beef burger Ive had in Islamabad The taste was quite balanced They didnt overload it with a variety of sauces like most restaurants do The beef patties used in the burger were premium and were cooked just enough to keep them juicy

I want to highlight a concerning issue regarding deceptive billing practices at the newly opened franchise of DopePakistan in I8 Markaz Islamabad They are charging a 15 GST on every bill regardless of whether the payment is made via cash or card

Whats worse even if you pay by card they issue a cash payment receipt while still adding GST This effectively means customers are being overcharged and the business is potentially evading tax obligations

I personally pointed this out to their staff but they showed zero interest in rectifying the issue Not only does this indicate poor customer service but it also raises serious concerns about fraudulent business practices

I urge DopePakistan to correct their billing system immediately acknowledge their mistake and reimburse customers for the extra GST they have wrongly collected

The food itself was a huge letdown It was bland overpriced and nothing like what was advertised The portions were small and the ingredients did not seem fresh I expected much better based on the reviews but it was clear that they were misleading The service was also slow and unprofessional The staff seemed uninterested in actually helping customers except when it came to getting positive reviews

To make things worse the cleanliness of the place was questionable The tables were not properly cleaned and the overall atmosphere felt uncomfortable It was clear that they were relying on fake hype rather than genuine quality

Like I said beef is sort of a rarity Its a shame because their beef burgers are actually pretty decent but their management is poor and the place gives vibes of just another burger joint close to losing itself to the sands of time They have a good product but their business management skills are below par I like supporting small burger businesses but Ive lost hope on this place because of the lack of passion and ambition on the managements part They literally buy the beef from one of the shops next to them when you order a burger it takes extra time and depends entirely on that shops timings There is so much potential but maybe a lack of BBA is making them bleed

We decided to go for the classic cheese pizza fries and refillable drinks The classic cheese pizza was a hit  a perfect balance of crispy crust melted cheese and the right amount of seasoning Every bite was incredibly satisfying and the generous cheese portion made it indulgent without being overwhelming The fries crispy and golden were the perfect accompaniment served hot and smothered with cheese The combination of these two items made for a delicious cheesy feast that hit the spot

Despite the restaurant being busy the staffs attentiveness made the experience seamless They took our order promptly and were always nearby to make sure we had everything we needed Our refillable drinks were topped up regularly without us having to ask and the staffs patience and friendly attitude throughout our time there really stood out They checked in on us to ensure we were enjoying our meal and even offered to refill our cups before they ran low It was clear that they were dedicated to providing excellent service even during the restaurants busiest hours

The overall vibe at Cheezious is fun and energetic with the food and service being the main draw The staff was not only efficient but also kind and understanding making sure we felt comfortable and taken care of They were quick to respond to any requests and maintained a positive attitude throughout which made our dining experience much more enjoyable Its always refreshing to see staff that is not only professional but genuinely friendly and approachable

All in all my visit to Cheezious was a fantastic experience Despite the crowd the staff ensured that we had a wonderful time and the food was exactly what we were hoping for  cheesy delicious and satisfying The classic cheese pizza fries and refillable drinks were the perfect combination for a laidback meal and the impeccable service made it all the more enjoyable Whether youre there for a quick bite or a relaxed meal with friends Cheezious delivers great food and even better service",Neutral

I had a terrible experience at this hospital during the birth of my son The doctors and management seem more focused on making money than providing proper medical care Initially we planned for a normal delivery but the doctor deliberately forced a Csection by prescribing medication that delayed labor

We were also forced to take a socalled VIP room even though other rooms were available They simply told us it was the only option The doctor rarely visited and the overall care was extremely poor

Without any medical necessity my son was taken to the nursery overnight which added 50000 rupees to our bill To make matters worse the nurses started formula feeding without our consent which led to longterm feeding issues I strongly suspect they have agreements with formula milk companies to push unnecessary formula feeding on newborns

In total we were charged 550000 rupees for a single delivery with many unjustified expenses Two years later my daughter was born in Canada through a normal delivery which is usually difficult after a Csection This shows how professional doctors in Canada handle cases ethically unlike this hospital where money comes first

I strongly warn others to stay away from this place Its not a hospital its a moneymaking business that exploits patients when they are most vulnerable",Negative

Yesterday we visited Ali Medical to get a Zytux Rituximab Biosimilar injection for my 8yearold nephew This was his final dose previously prescribed and clearly instructed by his doctor at Peshawar Northwest Hospital

Upon arrival we were told that we must first see a doctor at Ali Medical just to get a referral for the injectioneven though everything was already prescribed This unnecessary step cost us 4000 PKR in consultation fees

Then came the shocking part
 Bed charges for 8 hours 17500 PKR
 Mandatory advance payment 30000 PKR

With no choice we paid the amount But when collecting the remaining balance we were hit with another 5000 PKR admission and registration fee which was never mentioned upfront When I questioned this they had no proper justification

 Hidden charges unnecessary referrals and exploitative pricingAli Medical is purely businessdriven prioritizing profits over patient care Unfortunately there was no one available to address complaints at night

We made a 35 km journey through a frustrating traffic jam and despite our best efforts we reached the hospital around 9930 pm expecting to be seen within the doctors scheduled time However upon arrival we were shocked to find that the doctor had already left even though her working hours were supposed to go until midnight To make matters worse the staff informed us that the doctor had specifically told them not to call her for any late arrivals

This was incredibly unprofessional and left us feeling completely disregarded Not only did the doctor fail in her duty to stay and accommodate her patients but there was also a clear lack of communication from the hospital Its extremely frustrating to go through the effort of traveling such a long distance and then be turned away due to such poor management and a lack of accountability

I expect better especially when it comes to healthcare Its disheartening to see such disregard for patient care I would strongly advise others to think twice before choosing this facility",Negative

My recent visit to Dr Shumaila Mobashar was one of the worst healthcare experiences Ive ever had We had an appointment scheduled for 1130 AM and arrived early at 1120 AM checked in promptly and were told to wait After a brief oneminute interaction with the doctor she asked us to do an ultrasound which we did Following that the receptionist informed us that the doctor had left to perform a Csection and wouldnt return for an hour

During this time the nurses insisted we perform four additional tests costing us a staggering 14000 rupees Its clear that they pushed these unnecessary tests just to fill their own pockets while wasting our time After paying over 16000 rupees including the ultrasound we waited patiently only to find out two hours later that the doctor STILL hadnt returned

When we asked the receptionist why we werent informed of the delay earlier she rudely told us You could leave Nobodys asking you to wait This dismissive attitude is absolutely unacceptable Why make us pay for expensive tests and wait endlessly if you cant even provide the consultation we came for

This entire experience reeks of disorganization greed and complete disregard for patient time and money The lack of professionalism communication and respect shown by both Dr Shumaila and her staff is appalling I regret ever stepping into this clinic and would strongly advise others to avoid this place at all costs",Negative

I really wish more people left honest reviews when they arent treated right It would help others see the reality and avoid poorly managed places like this

I did get my refund but honestly PKR 2000 isnt the issueits their attitude and complete disregard for peoples time thats the real problem

I even had Iftar in the waiting area just to make it work At 7 PM they asked me to get a slip made saying the doctor was almost here I paid and got the sliponly to find out the doctor still wasnt there By 725 with no sign of the doctor I decided to leave and asked for a refund Instead of owning up to their mistake the PA had the audacity to say Sir aap compromise kar lain

To make matters worse they insisted on conducting a CBC test despite my clear explanation that we had already done the test just last week But these people are only interested in making money not in actual patient welfare Instead of providing necessary care they prioritize unnecessary procedures just to inflate the bill Their approach is completely unprofessional and exploitative

It was only by Allahs grace that my wife and baby remained safe despite their negligence Had anything gone wrong it would have been entirely their fault The level of incompetence and greed at this hospital is beyond unacceptable They do not care about patients they only care about profits I strongly urge others to be cautious and avoid falling into their trap Your health and your loved ones safety should never be put at risk by such irresponsible and moneyhungry individuals",Negative

Advantage
This bus is good to travel with family
Cold drinks and snacks are served in the middle of your journey 10 minutes stay in the middle of your journey Expanses per seat are around 1750 Chilled AC during the hot season heater in the cold season The bus does not stop in the middle of its journey 
Disadvantage
Kohistan local buses are present in Mandi Mord which charges 1450 per seat if you are traveling alone then it would be a great choice to travel in a local bus because its all about travel whether you travel in a local or in Dawoo class Local buses reach in 3 to 35 hours whereas Dawoo class takes 4 to 45 hours

I recently had the unfortunate experience of traveling with Islamabad Express and I must say it was an absolute nightmare The level of unprofessionalism and disregard for punctuality displayed by this bus service is truly astonishing

First and foremost the bus departure was delayed moving in deaprture cityby a staggering two hours without any explanation or apology from the staff This blatant disregard for the passengers time is simply unacceptable We were left waiting aimlessly wasting precious hours that could have been spent in the  traveling

The lack of communication and transparency from the bus service only added to the frustration There were no updates provided regarding the delay leaving passengers feeling stranded and uninformed It was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for Islamabad Express

To make matters worse the twohour delay had a cascading effect on the entire journey We arrived at our destination significantly later than the scheduled time causing inconvenience and disrupting our plans This level of inefficiency is inexcusable and reflects a complete lack of professionalism on the part of Islamabad Express

The entire experience with Islamabad Express was marred by a complete disregard for punctuality and customer satisfaction As a paying customer I expected a certain level of service and reliability which was clearly not met I would strongly advise against using Islamabad Express for any travel needs unless you have an abundance of time to spare and are prepared for endless delays

In conclusion my experience with Islamabad Express was extremely disappointing The late departure of the bus by two hours coupled with the lack of communication and overall inefficiency made for an unpleasant journey I sincerely hope that Islamabad Express takes these criticisms seriously and works towards improving their services for the sake of future passengers",Negative

I had my first experience with Q Connect back in 2020 which was exceptionally amazing Buses were new service was outstanding However my recent journey had been a disappointment I travelled from Islamabad to Lahore Onboard we were served a small water bottle and a half cup of juice at start
Plus Point Leg space is the only plus point in this price range
Observations
Q Connect is the only bus service in Pakistan which cost more than any of its competitors Way high after Air services from Lahore to Islamabad However the condition of buses and overall experience doesnt justify its priceRs6000 ticket
1  The coachs LCD screens out of service mostly
2 Seat recliner was not working
3 My side passenger was provided with a computer mouse for operating LCD as the touch was not working which seemed more funny as moises wire was short enough to be placed properly
4 No experience with toilet
5 No light refreshment as only a bottle of water and cup of juice in this price bracket do not suffice Even Faisal Movers First Class with half of Q Connect Fair provides bottle of water juice and a burger with a small cup cake
6 No seat massager inside the seats

Certainly not worth paying PKR 6000 for this journey Comparatively Faisal First Class Rs3100 ticket is more worthy for Lahore to Islamabad

Noisy Environment The ride was far from peaceful due to excessive noise inside the bus which made it difficult to relax

Wear and Tear The bus showed noticeable signs of aging with various issues including broken window curtains and wornout recliner seats

LowQuality Amenities The bottled water provided was from a lowgrade brand with substandard packaging not what Id expect from a service of this caliber

Slow Speed The bus averaged a speed of 95 kmhr which contributed to a delay of almost an hour from the expected arrival time

Comfort On the positive side the leg space was generous and the recliner seats were comfortable though they too showed signs of age

Overall while Q Connect still has some positives the decline in service quality and maintenance makes it hard to justify the premium I hope they take steps to restore the high standards they were once known for",Negative

The positive aspects include the availability of sockets decent seats and sufficient legroom However the negatives significantly outweigh these Despite it being late October the air conditioning is not working effectively and I am sweating Even after requesting the hostess twice to increase the ACs power she informed me that it was already at full capacity and to make matters worse the AC vents are fixed and cannot be adjusted

For a ticket priced at PKR 5950 there is no complimentary food which is disappointing The most frustrating part of this journey is the extremely poor suspension it is impossible to use my laptop on the table provided beneath the LED screen because the bus is shaking so much and I cannot imagine sleeping in this however I always sleep in other buses while travelling and I would rate the cleanliness of this bus a 410

I believe the higher management needs to address the maintenance issues of this bus Based on this unpleasant experience I will not be traveling with this service again and would rather opt for Daewoo Gold Class in the future",Negative
