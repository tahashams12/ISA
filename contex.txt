🧠 Project Description:
Islambad Sentiment analysis
 is a machine learning-powered mobile application that analyzes and visualizes public sentiments extracted from Google reviews of key public service categories — Hospitals, Malls, Restaurants, and Public Transport. The system is designed to provide users with an intuitive and informative interface to explore the best and worst-rated locations based on real-world customer feedback, using sentiment analysis and interactive visual tools.

The project involves three major components:

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Model Training (Logistic Regression)

Frontend (Flutter UI) + Backend (Flask API) integration for real-time predictions.

🔧 Tech Stack:
Frontend: Flutter (Material 3, v0.dev design)

Backend: Flask (Python)

ML Model: Logistic Regression with scikit-learn

Vectorizer: TF-IDF Vectorizer (vectorizer.pkl)

Data: Google Reviews (scraped and labeled)

Storage: CSV Dataset (with scope for database integration)

Mapping: Google Maps API

Charts: Flutter chart libraries (Pie, Bar, Boxplots)

📊 Dataset Features:
categoryName: (Hospitals, Malls, etc.)

location/lat, location/lang: Geocoordinates

title: Name of the place

stars: Google rating (1–5)

avg_rating: Average rating from reviews

cleaned_text: Preprocessed user review

sentiment: Derived sentiment label (Positive, Neutral, Negative)

🤖 Machine Learning Component:
Approach: Supervised classification

Model: Logistic Regression

Training: Based on labeled sentiment using star ratings

Output: Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment

Use Case: Real-time prediction of new user-submitted reviews

📱 App Features:
